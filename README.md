# About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This is a Rasterizer using C++, of course with the help from OLC or SDL later, for drawing lines and making a window etc. 

Why am I doing this:
* I want to learn more about graphic engines ðŸŽ²

As you can see, this will be an ongoing project and will grow continuously as I learn more.

## Built With

*  SDL/OLC engine, there might be OpenGL version in the future
